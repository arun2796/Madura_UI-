# 🎯 Controlled Production Stage Management Workflow

## Implementation Summary

A comprehensive controlled production stage management system with strict stage dependencies, quantity tracking, and one-way workflow enforcement.

---

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced JobCard Type Definition** (`src/services/api.ts`)

Added comprehensive tracking fields to the JobCard interface:

```typescript
export interface JobCard {
  // ... existing fields ...
  
  // Enhanced Quantity Tracking
  completedQuantity?: number; // Total completed across all stages
  
  // Product-wise allocations (from binding advice line items)
  productAllocations?: Array<{
    productId: string;
    productName: string;
    allocatedQuantity: number;
    completedQuantity: number;
    remainingQuantity: number;
  }>;
  
  // Stage allocations with product-wise tracking
  stageAllocations?: Array<{
    stageKey: string;
    stageName: string;
    allocatedQuantity: number;
    completedQuantity: number;
    remainingQuantity: number;
    status: "pending" | "in_progress" | "completed";
    startDate: string | null;
    completedDate: string | null;
    canMoveNext: boolean; // True only if 100% completed
    productProgress?: Array<{
      productId: string;
      productName: string;
      completedQuantity: number;
    }>;
  }>;
  
  // Dispatch tracking
  dispatchedQuantity?: number; // Total dispatched
  availableForDispatch?: number; // Completed but not yet dispatched
  dispatches?: Array<{
    dispatchId: string;
    dispatchedQuantity: number;
    dispatchDate: string;
    productBreakdown?: Array<{
      productId: string;
      productName: string;
      quantity: number;
    }>;
  }>;
}
```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Tracks completed quantities per stage
- ✅ Product-wise allocation tracking
- ✅ Dispatch history and remaining quantities
- ✅ Stage completion validation (`canMoveNext` flag)

---

### 2. **StageProgressTracker Component** (`src/components/StageProgressTracker.tsx`)

A visual component that enforces strict stage progression rules.

**Features:**
- ✅ **Visual Stage Progress**: Shows all 7 production stages with status indicators
- ✅ **Completion Tracking**: Displays allocated/completed/remaining quantities per stage
- ✅ **Access Control**: Only allows access to current or completed stages
- ✅ **Progress Bars**: Visual representation of stage completion percentage
- ✅ **Product Details**: Optional product-wise progress display
- ✅ **Status Alerts**: Clear messages about stage requirements

**Stage Status Indicators:**
- 🟢 **Completed**: Green checkmark, 100% progress
- 🔵 **In Progress**: Blue animated circle, partial progress
- ⏳ **Pending**: Gray circle, locked until previous stage completes
- 🔒 **Locked**: Cannot access future stages

**UI Elements:**
- Stage cards with color-coded borders
- Three-column quantity display (Allocated/Completed/Remaining)
- Progress bars with percentage
- Product-wise breakdown (optional)
- Overall progress summary

---

### 3. **Updated ProductionStageFlow Page** (`src/pages/ProductionStageFlow.tsx`)

Complete rewrite with strict workflow controls.

**Key Changes:**

#### **State Management:**
```typescript
const [currentStageIndex, setCurrentStageIndex] = useState(0);
const [stageProgressData, setStageProgressData] = useState<StageProgress[]>([]);
const [stageProductQuantities, setStageProductQuantities] = useState<...>({});
```

#### **Strict Navigation Rules:**
1. **No Backward Navigation**: Previous button is permanently disabled
2. **100% Completion Required**: Next button only enabled when current stage is 100% complete
3. **Sequential Processing**: Must complete stages in order (Design → Procurement → Printing → Cutting & Binding → Gathering & Binding → Quality → Packing)

#### **Workflow Functions:**
- `initializeStageProgress()`: Loads stage data from job card
- `canMoveToNextStage()`: Validates 100% completion before allowing progression
- `handleNextStage()`: Moves to next stage only if validation passes
- `handleSaveProgress()`: Saves all stage data and updates job card status

#### **UI Layout:**
- **Left Panel**: StageProgressTracker showing all stages
- **Right Panel**: Current stage details with:
  - Product-wise completion inputs
  - Team assignment
  - Stage notes
  - Navigation buttons (Previous disabled, Next conditional)

#### **Automatic Status Updates:**
- Calculates `availableForDispatch` when all stages are completed
- Updates job card status to "completed" when all stages done
- Tracks total completed quantity across all stages

---

### 4. **Updated DispatchForm** (`src/components/forms/DispatchForm.tsx`)

Enhanced to show only fully completed products and track dispatches.

**Key Changes:**

#### **Filtering Logic:**
```typescript
const completedJobCards = jobCards.filter((jc) => {
  // Check if all production stages are completed
  const allStagesCompleted = jc.stageAllocations?.every(
    (stage) => stage.status === "completed"
  ) || false;
  
  // Check if there's available quantity for dispatch
  const availableForDispatch = jc.availableForDispatch || 0;
  const alreadyDispatched = jc.dispatchedQuantity || 0;
  const hasAvailableQuantity = availableForDispatch > alreadyDispatched;

  // Only show job cards with:
  // 1. All stages completed
  // 2. Available quantity not yet dispatched
  return allStagesCompleted && hasAvailableQuantity;
});
```

**Features:**
- ✅ **Strict Filtering**: Only shows job cards with ALL stages completed
- ✅ **Quantity Tracking**: Uses `availableForDispatch` - `dispatchedQuantity`
- ✅ **Automatic Removal**: Job cards disappear from list once fully dispatched
- ✅ **Dispatch History**: Tracks all dispatches in job card record

#### **Job Card Update on Dispatch:**
```typescript
updateJobCard.mutate({
  id: formData.jobCardId,
  data: {
    dispatchedQuantity: newDispatchedTotal,
    availableForDispatch: Math.max(0, newAvailableForDispatch),
    dispatches: [...dispatches, newDispatchRecord],
    updatedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
  },
});
```

## 🔄 Complete Workflow

### **1. Binding Advice → Job Card**
- Create binding advice with total quantity (e.g., 2000 units)
- Create job card, select products and quantities from binding advice
- Job card tracks product allocations

### **2. Job Card → Production Stages**
- Navigate to Production Stage Management
- Process through 7 sequential stages:
  1. **Design** → Planning and design work
  2. **Procurement** → Material sourcing
  3. **Printing** → Printing operations
  4. **Cutting & Binding** → Cutting and folding
  5. **Gathering & Binding** → Assembly
  6. **Quality** → Quality inspection
  7. **Packing** → Final packing

**Rules:**
- ✅ Must complete 100% of allocated quantity before moving to next stage
- ✅ Cannot go backward once a stage is completed
- ✅ Product-wise tracking through each stage
- ✅ Real-time quantity validation

### **3. Production → Dispatch**
- Only job cards with ALL stages completed appear in dispatch dropdown
- Shows available quantity (completed - already dispatched)
- Creates dispatch record
- Updates job card with dispatched quantity
- Removes from dispatch list when fully dispatched

### **4. Dispatch → Invoice**
- Only fully dispatched products available for invoicing
- Complete audit trail from binding advice to invoice
